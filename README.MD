## Features

- Generate random passwords with customizable length.
- Include or exclude various character types such as symbols, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers.
- Copy generated passwords to the clipboard with the click of a button.
- Responsive design for seamless usage across different devices.

## Usage

To use the Random Password Generator:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Adjust the desired password length and select the character types you want to include.
3. Click the "Generate Password" button to generate a random password.
4. Optionally, click the "Copy" button to copy the generated password to the clipboard.

## How It Works

The generator uses JavaScript to randomly select characters from predefined arrays based on the selected criteria. These characters are then concatenated to form the final password, which is displayed to the user.
